# The global minimum cut problem in a graph is a classic problem in graph theory.
# Given an undirected, weighted graph, a minimum cut is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets,
# such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing the partition is minimized.
# The goal is to find the cut with the smallest total weight.
# One algorithm that is often used to solve the global minimum cut problem is the Stoer-Wagner algorithm.
# Works for undirected weighted graph
